# Game Test Design

**Workflow ID**: `_bmad/gds/gametest/test-design`
**Version**: 1.0 (BMad v6)

---

## Overview

Create comprehensive test scenarios for game projects, covering gameplay mechanics, progression systems, multiplayer functionality, and platform requirements. This workflow produces a prioritized test plan based on risk assessment and player impact.

---

## Preflight Requirements

- ✅ Game design documentation available (GDD, feature specs)
- ✅ Understanding of target platforms
- ✅ Knowledge of core gameplay loop

---

## Step 1: Gather Context

### Actions

1. **Read Game Design Documentation**
   - Locate GDD or game-design.md
   - Identify core mechanics and features
   - Note target platforms and certification requirements

2. **Identify Critical Systems**
   - Core gameplay loop
   - Progression/save systems
   - Multiplayer (if applicable)
   - Monetization (if applicable)

3. **Assess Risk Areas**
   - Player-facing features (highest priority)
   - Data persistence (save/load)
   - Platform certification requirements
   - Performance-critical paths

| ------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| Certification | TRC/XR requirements | P0       |
| Input         | Controller support  | P0       |
| Performance   | FPS, loading times  | P1       |
| Accessibility | Assist features     | P1       |

### E2E Journey Testing

**Knowledge Base Reference**: `knowledge/e2e-testing.md`

| Category | Focus | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Core Loop | Complete gameplay cycle | P0 |
| Turn Lifecycle | Full turn from start to end | P0 |
| Save/Load Round-trip | Save → quit → load → resume | P0 |
| Scene Transitions | Menu → Game → Back | P1 |
| Win/Lose Paths | Victory and defeat conditions | P1 |

## Step 3: Create Test Scenarios

### Scenario Format

For each critical feature, create scenarios using this format:

```
SCENARIO: [Descriptive Name]
  GIVEN [Initial state/preconditions]
  WHEN [Action taken]
  THEN [Expected outcome]
  PRIORITY: P0/P1/P2/P3
  CATEGORY: [gameplay/progression/multiplayer/platform]
```

### Example Scenarios

**Gameplay - Combat**

```
SCENARIO: Basic Attack Hits Enemy
  GIVEN player is within attack range of enemy
  AND enemy has 100 health
  WHEN player performs basic attack
  THEN enemy receives damage
  AND damage feedback plays (visual + audio)
  AND enemy health decreases
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: gameplay
```

**Progression - Save System**

```
SCENARIO: Save Preserves Player Progress
  GIVEN player has 500 gold and 3 items
  AND player is at checkpoint
  WHEN game saves
  AND game is reloaded
  THEN player has 500 gold
  AND player has same 3 items
  AND player is at same checkpoint
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: progression
```

**Multiplayer - Network Degradation**

```
SCENARIO: Gameplay Under High Latency
  GIVEN 2 players in session
  AND network latency is 200ms
  WHEN Player 1 attacks Player 2
  THEN damage is applied correctly
  AND positions remain synchronized
  AND no desync occurs
  PRIORITY: P1
  CATEGORY: multiplayer
```

### E2E Scenario Format

For player journey tests, use this extended format:
```
E2E SCENARIO: [Player Journey Name]
  GIVEN [Initial game state - use ScenarioBuilder terms]
  WHEN [Sequence of player actions]
  THEN [Observable outcomes]
  TIMEOUT: [Expected max duration in seconds]
  PRIORITY: P0/P1
  CATEGORY: e2e
  INFRASTRUCTURE: [Required fixtures/builders]
```

### Example E2E Scenario
```
E2E SCENARIO: Complete Combat Encounter
  GIVEN game loaded with player unit adjacent to enemy
  AND player unit has full health and actions
  WHEN player selects unit
  AND player clicks attack on enemy
  AND player confirms attack
  AND attack animation completes
  AND enemy responds (if alive)
  THEN enemy health is reduced OR enemy is defeated
  AND turn state advances appropriately
  AND UI reflects new state
  TIMEOUT: 15
  PRIORITY: P0
  CATEGORY: e2e
  INFRASTRUCTURE: ScenarioBuilder, InputSimulator, AsyncAssert
```

## Step 4: Prioritize Test Coverage

### Priority Assignment

**Knowledge Base Reference**: `knowledge/test-priorities.md`

| Priority | Criteria | Unit | Integration | E2E | Manual |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| P0 | Ship blockers | 100% | 80% | Core flows | Smoke |
| P1 | Major features | 90% | 70% | Happy paths | Full |
| P2 | Secondary | 80% | 50% | - | Targeted |
| P3 | Edge cases | 60% | - | - | As needed |

### Risk-Based Ordering

1. **Critical Path** - Main gameplay loop
2. **Data Integrity** - Save/load, progression
3. **Platform Requirements** - Certification items
4. **User Experience** - Feel, polish, accessibility
