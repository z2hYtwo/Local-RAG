# Engine MCP Servers - Game engine MCP integrations for AI-assisted development
# Used during Step 3 (engine selection) to recommend relevant MCP servers
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: All MCP availability and versions MUST be verified via WebSearch
# This file provides: known MCPs, search terms for discovery, and capability descriptions
# MCP ecosystem evolves rapidly - always verify repos are active and maintained
#
# MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give AI agents direct access to game engine
# features like scene inspection, asset queries, and live debugging - dramatically
# improving AI-assisted game development.

      **AI Development Tools (MCP Servers)**

      MCP servers let your AI assistant interact directly with {{engine}}.
      For your project, I'd recommend:

      - **{{mcp_name}}**: {{benefit_summary}}
        Repo: {{repo}}

      These are optional but significantly improve AI-assisted development.
      Include MCP setup in your architecture? [y/n]

  beginner:
    style: "Full explanation of what MCPs are and why they help"
    example: |
      **AI Development Tools**

      There's a way to give your AI assistant "eyes" into {{engine}} -
      called MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Think of it like giving
      your AI assistant a window into your game editor.

      For {{engine}}, there's **{{mcp_name}}** which lets the AI:
      {{friendly_capability_list}}

      This means instead of describing your scene layout in chat,
      the AI can just look at it directly.

      Want to set this up? [y/n]
